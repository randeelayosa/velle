## Description

This application is an Independent Capstone project, culminating my knowledge and experience gained during my 27 weeks time at [Epicodus](https://www.epicodus.com/) in the Front-End Development track. It demonstrates a knowledge of React.js and an aptitude for planning, designing, and developing a functional application that meets the UX/UI industry standards of today.

_<p align="center">"Velle" - Latin: to wish, want, be willing</p>_

_Velle is a pseudo company/organization that operates as a middle man between various public outreach supporters, and individuals who want to help their fellow neighbors by donating their clothes. Recently, I have found myself in a predicament that I am sure others share as well. Many of us have unwanted or unneeded clothes that are trendy brand named or were bought at a modest but higher price. People may not want to hand these items to a store as they offer extremely low buying prices in return. And, knowing how much they had originally bought these items for, these people may also not want to hand the clothes over to Goodwill for free just to be resold for 100% profit to someone else. I and others, I'm sure, would much rather place our donations in the hands of reputable outreach organizations and programs who will in turn place the items directly in the hands of the individual in need. Velle stands as the organizer, liaison, and middle man that would make an operation like this possible. Benevolence._
